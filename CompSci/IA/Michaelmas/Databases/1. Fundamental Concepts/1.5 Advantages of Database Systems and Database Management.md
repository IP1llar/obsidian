# 1.5.1 Data Independence
**Data Independence**: Changes in data definitions have minimal to no impact on the applications using the data
- Happen in internal or conceptual/logical layer

**Physical data independence**: Neither the applications, views, or logical data model must be changed when changes are made to to data storage specifications in the internal data model
- Could be moving storage locations or defining new access paths etc.
- The guarantee physical data independence, the DBMS should provide interfaces between the logical and internal data models

**Logical data independence**: Software application are minimally affected by changes in the conceptual or logical data model
- E.g. adding new data
	- Views protect the applications
- To guarantee logical data independence, DBMS provides interfaces between conceptual/logical and external layers.
