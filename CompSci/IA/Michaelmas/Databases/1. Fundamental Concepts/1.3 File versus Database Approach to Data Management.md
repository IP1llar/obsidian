# 1.3.1 The File-Based Approach
Every application stored its data into its own dedicated files.
![[Pasted image 20240613205219.png]]
The data files only contain the data themselves; the data definitions and descriptions are included in each application separately.

Issues:
- Duplicate/Redundant information will be stored
	- Waste of storage resources
	- Inconsistent Data: Data can be updated in one file and not elsewhere
- Strong coupling/dependency between applications and the data
	- Structural change in data file => changes in all applications that use it
	- **Concurrency Control** is hard to manage (Inconsistent data)
		- E.g. one application performs cash transfer and another calculates the account balance when the data operations are interleaved
- Since the applications work independently with their own ecosystem it is difficult (expensive) to integrate applications aimed at cross-company services
- Code needs knowledge of the file system for example:
``` psuedocode
Procedure FindCustomer
Begin
	open file Customer.txt;
	Read(Customer)
	While not EOF(Customer)
		If Customer.name='Bart' Then
			display(Customer);
		EndIf
	Read(Customer);
	EndWhile;
End;
```

# 1.3.2 The Database Approach
In the Database Approach, all data are stored and managed centrally by a DBMS
![[00018.jpeg]]
The DBMS stores and manages:
- raw data
- **metadata**: data definitions now stored in the catalog of the DBMS instead of the applications
Applications interface with the DBMS without needing to know the structure, only what they want:
``` SQL
SELECT *
FROM Customer
WHERE
name = 'Bart'
```
