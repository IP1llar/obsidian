# 1.4.1 Database Model versus Instances
It is important to distinguish between data definitions, and actual data.

**Database Model** or **Database Schema**:
- Provides description of the database data at different levels of detail
- Specifies various data items, their characteristics, relationships, constraints, storage details etc...
- Is specified during database design and is *not expected to change frequently*.
- Is stored in the *catalog* (the heart of the DBMS)

**Database State** represents the data in the database at a particular moment
- Sometimes called the *current set of instances*
- Typically changes upon data manipulations

Example Database model:

``` SQL
Student (number, name, address, email)
Course (number, name)
Building (number, address)
```

# 1.4.2 Data Model
Comprises different data models, each describing data from different perspectives
- Clear and unambiguous description of the data items, their relationships, and data constraints

**Conceptual data model**: provides a high-level description of the data items with their characteristics and relationships 
- A communication instrument between information architect and business user to capture and model data requirements
- Should be implementation-independent, user-friendly, close to how the business user perceives the data
- Usually represented using an **Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER)** model or an object-oriented model

**Logical data model**: Translation or mapping of the conceptual data model toward a specific implementation environment
- Not too far removed from the physical data organization but may still be understood by business users
- Could be one of: hierarchical, CODASYL, relational, object-oriented, extended relational, XML, NoSQL model
- Can be mapped to an internal data model representing the physical storage details.
- Highly DBMS-specific

**External data model**: contains various subsets of the data items in the logical model, also called **views**, tailored toward the needs of specific applications or groups of users

# 1.4.3 The Three-Layer Architecture
Essential element of every database application describing how the different underlying data models are related. It has several advantages in efficiency, maintenance, performance, security, etc.

![[00020.jpeg]]
Changes in one layer should have no(little) impact on the others. 
**Conceptual/Logical layer**:
- Conceptual and logical data models
- Focus on data items, relationships etc, without mentioning the physical implementation
- User-friendly and transparent
- Refined to logical data model upon the implementation environment

**External Layer**: 
- External data model - includes views
- **View**:
	- Describes the part of the database that a particular application or user group is interested in hiding the rest
- Controls data access and enforce security

**Internal Layer**:
- Internal data model - physical implementation
