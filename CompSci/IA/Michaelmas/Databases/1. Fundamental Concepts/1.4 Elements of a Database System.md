# 1.4.1 Database Model versus Instances
It is important to distinguish between data definitions, and actual data.

**Database Model** or **Database Schema**:
- Provides description of the database data at different levels of detail
- Specifies various data items, their characteristics, relationships, constraints, storage details etc...
- Is specified during database design and is *not expected to change frequently*.
- Is stored in the *catalog* (the heart of the DBMS)

**Database State** represents the data in the database at a particular moment
- Sometimes called the *current set of instances*
- Typically changes upon data manipulations

Example Database model:

``` SQL
Student (number, name, address, email)
Course (number, name)
Building (number, address)
```

# 1.4.2 Data Model
Comprises different data models, each describing data from different perspectives
- Clear and unambiguous description of the data items, their relationships, and data constraints

**Conceptual data model**: provides a high-level description of the data items with their characteristics and relationships 
- A communication instrument between information architect and business user to capture and model data requirements
- Should be implementation-independent, user-friendly, close to how the business user perceives the data
- Usually represented using an **Enhanced Entity Relationship (EER)** model or an object-oriented model

**Logical data model**: Translation or mapping of the conceptual data model toward a specific implementation environment
- Not too far removed from the physical data organization but may still be understood by business users
- Could be one of: hierarchical, CODASYL, relational, object-oriented, extended relational, XML, NoSQL model
- Can be mapped to an internal data model representing the physical storage details.
- Highly DBMS-specific

**External data model**: contains various subsets of the data items in the logical model, also called **views**, tailored toward the needs of specific applications or groups of users

# 1.4.3 The Three-Layer Architecture
Essential element of every database application describing how the different underlying data models are related. It has several advantages in efficiency, maintenance, performance, security, etc.

![[00020.jpeg]]
Changes in one layer should have no(little) impact on the others. 
**Conceptual/Logical layer**:
- Conceptual and logical data models
- Focus on data items, relationships etc, without mentioning the physical implementation
- User-friendly and transparent
- Refined to logical data model upon the implementation environment

**External Layer**: 
- External data model - includes views
- **View**:
	- Describes the part of the database that a particular application or user group is interested in hiding the rest
- Controls data access and enforce security

**Internal Layer**:
- Internal data model - physical implementation

Procurement Business Example:
3 views for different uses:

# 1.4.4 Catalog
**Catalog**: heart of the DBMS containing data definitions/metadata of your database application
- Stores the definitions of the views, logical and internal data models, and synchronizes these three data models to ensure their consistency.

# 1.4.5 Database Users
Various types of users interact with the database:
- *Information Architect* designs the conceptual model
- *Business User* works with Information Architect to make sure data requirements fully understood and modelled
- *Database Designer* translates conceptual data model into logical and internal data models.
- *Database Administrator (DBA)* responsible for implementation and monitoring of database
	- Sets up infrastructure and monitors its performance by KPIs (response times, throughput rates, storage space consumed)
- *Application Developer* develops database applications in a general-purpose programming language
	- Provides data requirements to database designer into view definitions
	- Business user runs the applications to perform specific operations

# 1.4.6 Database Languages
**Data Definition Language (DDL)** used by DBA to express the database's external, logical, and internal data models (stored in catalog)

**Data Manipulation Language (DML)** used to retrieve, insert, delete, and modify data.
- DML can be embedded in a general purpose language, or front-end querying tool

SQL offer both DDL and DML statements for *relational* database systems.
