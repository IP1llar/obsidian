A **list** is a collection of elements, separated with `;`, surrounded by `[` and `]`. 
``` ocaml
[1; 2; 3]
- : int list
```
A list of integers has type `int list` - all elements must have the same type.
Lists are ordered: `[1; 2; 3]` and `[1; 3; 2]` are different.

The **head** is the first element.
The **tail** is the rest of the list collectively
- It has the same type as the whole list

The **empty list** `[]` doesn't have a head or a tail

# List operators

**Cons** operator `::` adds a single element to the front of an existing list. It is completed in a constant amount of time (independent of the length of the list):
``` ocaml
false :: [true; false]
=> [false; true; false]
```

**Append operator** `@` is used to combine two lists together. This takes time proportional to the length of the list on the left hand side of the `@` operator:
``` ocaml
[1; 2] @ [3; 4; 5]
=> [1; 2; 3; 4; 5]
```

# Functions using lists
## isnil
``` ocaml
isnil : 'a list -> bool

let isnil l =
	match l with
		[] -> true
	|   _ -> false
```
The argument has type `'a list` where `'a` stands for any type. If two types have the same letter they must have the same type. Functions like this are **polymorphic**.

## length
``` ocaml
let rec length l = 
	match l with
		[] -> 0
	|   h::t -> 1 + length t

length [5; 5; 5]
=> 1 + length [5; 5]
=> 1 + (1 + length [5])
=> 1 + (1 + (1 + length []))
=> 1 + (1 + (1 + (0))) = 3
```
`h::t` pattern matches to extract the head and tail. We can replace `h` with `_` as the variable is not used.
Note that the time is `O(n)`. Space is also `O(n)` because the intermediate expression `1 + (1 + (1 +...` is built up before any `+` operation is evaluated and must be stored somewhere before being processed.

## Sum
We can make a similar function to add a list of integers.
``` ocaml
let rec sum l =
	match l with
		[] -> 0
	|   h::t -> h + sum t
```
Since it is a list of integers, the function is not polymorphic and instead has type `sum : list int -> int`.

## Accumulator
To deal with the space usage, we can use an **accumulator**. We "accumulate" the 1s in an extra argument.
``` ocaml
length_inner : 'a list -> list -> int
length : 'a list -> int

let rec length_inner l n =
	match l with
		[] -> n
	|   h::t k -> length_inner t (n + 1)

let length l = length_inner l 0

length [5; 5; 5]
=> length_inner [5; 5; 5] 0
=> length_inner [5; 5] 1
=> length_inner [5] 2
=> length_inner [] 3
=> 3
```
There is an 'inner' function to make calling it with a initial value of `0` easier. The space taken by the calculation does not relate to the length of the list argument
#### Tail Recursion
Recursive function which do not build up a growing intermediate expression are known as **tail recursive**.

## Odd elements
Functions can also return lists too.
``` ocaml
odd_elements : 'a list -> 'a list

let rec odd_elements l =
	match l with
		a::_::t -> a :: odd_elements t
	|   _ -> l

odd_elements [2; 4; 2; 4; 2]
=> 2 :: odd_elements [2; 4; 2]
=> 2 :: 2 :: odd_elements [2]
=> 2 :: 2 :: [2]
*
=> [2; 2; 2]
```

## Append
We can implement append without the `@` operator.
``` ocaml
append : 'a list -> 'a list -> 'a list

let rec append a b =
	match a with 
		[] -> b
	|   h::t -> h :: append t b

append [1; 2; 3] [4; 5; 6]
=> 1 :: append [2; 3] [4; 5; 6]
=> 1 :: 2 :: append [3] [4; 5; 6]
=> 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: append [] [4; 5; 6]
=> 1 :: 2 :: 3 :: [4; 5; 6]
*
=> [1; 2; 3; 4; 5; 6]
```
The second list is not processed so it is proportional to the length of the first list.

## Reverse
``` ocaml
rev : 'a list -> 'a list

let rec rev l =
	match l with
		[] -> []
	|   h::t -> rev t @ [h]

rev [1; 2; 3; 4]
=> rev [2; 3; 4] @ [1]
=> (rev [3; 4] @ [2]) @ [1]
=> ((rev [4] @ [3]) @ [2]) @ [1]
=> (((rev [] @ [4]) @ [3]) @ [2]) @ [1]
=> ((([] @ [4]) @ [3]) @ [2]) @ [1]
*
=> [4; 3; 2; 1]
```
This is not very efficient as it is `O(n)` for time and space.

## Take and Drop
Given a number and a list, either `take` or `drop` that many elements from the list:
``` ocaml
take : int -> 'a list -> 'a list
drop : int -> 'a list -> 'a list

let rec take n l =
	if n = 0 then [] else
		match l with
			h::t -> h :: take (n - 1) t

let rec drop n l =
	if n = 0 then l else
		match l with
			h :: t -> drop (n - 1) t
```

``` ocaml
take 2 [2; 4; 6; 8; 10]
=> [2] :: take 1 [4; 6; 8; 10]
=> [2] :: [4] :: take 0 [6; 8; 10]
=> [2] :: [4] :: []
*=> [2; 4]

drop 2 [2; 4; 6; 8; 10]
=> drop 1 [4; 6; 8; 10]
=> drop 0 [6; 8; 10]
=> [6; 8; 10]
```

# Questions
1. Write a function `evens` which does the opposite to `odds`, returning the even numbered elements in a list. For example, `evens [2; 4; 2; 4; 2]` should return `[4; 4]`. What is the type of your function?
``` ocaml
evens : 'a list -> 'a list

let rec evens l =
	match l with
		_ :: a :: t -> a :: evens t
	|   _ -> []
```
2. Write a function `count_true` which counts the number of `true` elements in a list. What is the type of your function? Can you write a tail recursive version?
``` ocaml
count_true : bool list -> int
count_inner : bool list -> int -> int

let rec count_inner l n =
	match l with
		true :: t -> count_inner t (n + 1)
	|   false :: t -> count_inner t n
	|   _ -> n

let count_true l = count_inner l 0
```
3. Write a function which, given a list, builds a palindrome from it. A palindrome is a list which equals its own reverse. You can assume the existence of `rev` and `@`. Write another function which determines if a list is a palindrome.
``` ocaml
let make_palindrome l =
	l @ rev l

let palindrome l =
	l = rev l
```
4. Write a function `drop_last` which returns all but the last element of a list. If the list is empty, it should return the empty list. So, for example, `drop_last [1; 2; 4; 8]` should return `[1; 2; 4]`. What about a tail recursive version?
``` ocaml
let rec drop_last l= 
	drop_last_inner l []

let rec drop_last_inner l a =
	match l with
		[_] | [] -> rev a
	|   h :: t  -> drop_last_inner t (h :: a)
```
5. Write a function member of type `'a -> 'a list -> bool` which returns true if an element exists in a list, or false if not. For example, `member 2 [1; 2; 3]` should evaluate to `true`, but `member 3 [1; 2]` should evaluate to `false`.
``` ocaml
let rec member m l =
	match l with
		h::t -> h = m || member m t
	|   _ -> false
```
6. Use your `member` function to write a function `make_set` which, given a list, returns a list which contains all the elements of the original list, but has no duplicate elements. For example, `make_set [1; 2; 3; 3; 1]` might return `[2; 3; 1]`. What is the type of your function?
``` ocaml
let rec make_set_inner l a
	match l with
		h::t -> if member h a then make_set_inner t a else make_set_inner t (h :: a)
	| _ -> a

let make_set l = make_set_inner l []
```
7. Can you explain why the `rev` function we defined is inefficient? How does the time it takes to run relate to the size of its argument? Can you write a more efficient version using an accumulating argument? What is its efficiency in terms of time taken and space used?
	- The `rev` function is not tail recursive so takes space `O(n)`.
``` ocaml
let rec rev_inner l a = 
	match l with
		h::t -> rev_inner t (h :: a)
		| [] -> a

let rev l = rev_inner l []
```
