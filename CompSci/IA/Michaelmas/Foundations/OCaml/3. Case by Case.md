## Pattern Matching
`if ... then ... else` conditional expressions can quickly become hard to read, and expand quickly in size and complexity

OCaml has `pattern matching`. Recall, 
``` ocaml
factorial : int -> int

let rec factorial a =
	if a = 1 then 1 else a * factorial (a - 1)
```

We can use pattern matching to rewrite it as the following:
``` ocaml
factorial : int -> int

let rec factorial a = 
	match a with
		1 -> 1
	|   _ -> a * factorial (a - 1)
```

We can read this as "See if `a` matches the pattern `1`. If it does, just return `1`. If not, see if it matches the pattern `_`. If it does, the result is `a * factorial (a - 1)`".

The pattern `_` matches anything.

Rewriting `isvowel`:
``` ocaml
isvowel : char -> bool

let isvowel c =
	match c with
		'a' -> true
	|   'e' -> true
	|   'i' -> true
	|   'o' -> true
	|   'u' -> true
	|   _ -> false
```
Matches can be combined:
``` ocaml
isvowel : char -> bool

let isvowel c =
	match c with
		'a' | 'e' | 'i' | 'o' | 'u' -> true
	|   _ -> false
```

OCaml will warn about non-exhaustive pattern matching:

``` ocaml
# let isvowel c =
	match c with 
		'a' | 'e' | 'i' | 'o' | 'u' -> true;;
Warning 8 [partial-match]: this pattern-matching is not exhaustive.
Here is an example of a case that is not matched:
'b'

val isvowel : char -> bool = <fun>
```

Euclid's Algorithm:
``` ocaml
gcd : int -> int -> int

let rec gcd a b =
	match b with
		0 -> a
	|   _ -> gcd b (a mod b)
```

The type of a whole `match ... with ...` expression is determined by the types of the expressions on the right hand side of each `->` arrow, all of which must be alike. 
We use pattern matching whenever it is easier to read and understand than `if ... then ... else` expressions.


# Questions
1. Rewrite the `not` function from the previous chapter in pattern matching style.
``` ocaml
not : bool -> bool

let not x = 
	match x with
		true -> false
	|   false -> true
```
2. Use pattern matching to write a recursive function which, given a positive integer `n`, returns the sum of all the integers from `1` to `n`.
``` ocaml
sum : int -> int

let rec sum n =
	match n with
		1 -> 1
	|   _ -> n + sum (n - 1)
```
3. Use pattern matching to write a function which, given two numbers `x` and `n`, computes $x^n$. 
``` ocaml
power : int -> int -> int

let rec power x n = 
	match n with 
		1 -> x
	|   _ -> x * power x (n - 1)
```
