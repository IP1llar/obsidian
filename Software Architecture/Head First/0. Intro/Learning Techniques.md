## 1. Slow down
The more you understand, the less you have to memorize
- Have a conversation with the book
- Answer the questions

## 2. Do the exercises
- Not doing them is like having someone else doing you workouts for you

## 3. Read the "There are no dumb questions"

## 4. Make this the last thing you read before bed
- Or at least the last challenging thing
- Part of learning happens *after* you put the book down
- If you put something new in during that processing time, some of what you just learned will be lost

## 5. Talk about it
- Speaking activates a different part of the brain
- Try to explain it out loud to someone else

## 6. Drink water
- Dehydration decreases cognitive function

## 7. Listen to your brain
- If you find yourself just skimming the surface, it's break time
- Past a certain point, you won't learn faster/may hurt the process

## 8. Feel something
- Your brain needs to know this matters
- Get involved with the stories
- Make up captions

## 9. Apply it every day
- Practice
- Don't skip over the problems
