The four dimensions meet in the middle
- Each dimension *must align*

Each dimension must line up with every other

## There are no dumb questions

 Q: Do you need all four dimensions when creating an architecture, or can you skip some if you don't have time?

- Skipping some is a common mistake

	- What are its logical components?
	- What are the major decisions?
