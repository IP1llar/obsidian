The structure of a home is its **architecture** 
- It's shape
- The number of floors and rooms

A building plan contains all the lines and boxes necessary to build the house
- Structural things are **important** and hard to change later

Similarly for software systems, architecture is essential
- Scalability
- Reliability
- Maintainability

### Exercise
How does planning a garden relate to software architecture?

- Plants take time to grow and this needs to be planned for with space
	- Similarly, systems usage can evolve over time and can be architectured to scale
- Water must be readily available and plants water requirements planned for
	- Parts of software require different data and access to other systems which must be planned for
- Weeds can grow if not enough attention is given
	- Like bugs or deprecated technology
