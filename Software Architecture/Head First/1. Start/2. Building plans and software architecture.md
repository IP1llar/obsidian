What does the "building plan" of a software system look like?
- Lines and boxes (lol)
- Specifies the structure
	- Rooms
	- Walls
	- Stairs

Software Architecture Diagram specifies its structure
- User interfaces
- Services
- Databases
- Communication Protocols

Both provide *guidelines and constraints*

Note: A floor plan on specifies architecture/structure, not design (like paint etc)
